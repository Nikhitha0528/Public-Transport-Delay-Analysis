# Public-Transport-Delay-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing public transport delays using Power BI.  The goal was to understand the key factors affecting delays such as route performance, weather conditions, and traffic congestion.  In addition to historical analysis, time-series forecasting was implemented to estimate future delay trends.
