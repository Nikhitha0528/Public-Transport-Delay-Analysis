# Public Transport Delay Analysis (Power BI Project)

**Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing public transport delays using Power BI. 
The goal was to understand the key factors affecting delays such as route performance, weather conditions, and traffic congestion. 
In addition to historical analysis, time-series forecasting was implemented to estimate future delay trends.

**Objective

The main objective of this project is:
> To analyze average delay patterns across routes
> To understand how weather and traffic impact delays
> To identify high-delay routes
> To use forecasting to predict future delay trends
> To build an interactive dashboard for better decision-making

**Tools & Technologies Used

> Power BI
> DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
> Data Visualization Techniques
> Time-Series Forecasting (Power BI Analytics Pane)

**Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes:

> KPI Cards (Average Delay, Traffic Congestion, Delay %)
> Route-wise Delay Analysis
> Weather Impact Analysis
> Traffic Congestion vs Delay Correlation (Scatter Plot)
> Time-Series Delay Trend with Forecast
> Interactive Date Slicer

**Key Insights

Some important observations from the analysis:

> Certain routes consistently show higher delays.
> Rain and adverse weather conditions increase delays.
> Higher traffic congestion correlates with increased delay.
> Forecasting suggests delay trends remain stable within a specific range.
